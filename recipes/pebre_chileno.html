        <h2 class="recipe-titles">DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="recipe-description"> 
            It's a sauce or condiment served at home and at restaurants in <strong>Chile</strong> to complement many meals. 
            <em>Pebre</em> combines cilantro, onion, tomato, and <em>Aj√≠ Cristal</em> (sweet or spicy pepper), with vinegar and oil. 
            It's very old and traditional. Each family in Chile has its own recipe.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 onion chopped very small (white or yellow onion)</li>
            <li>1 bunch of cilantro or 2 cups of cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1-2 tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of paprika powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of red chili sauce, like Tabasco</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop the onion finely, can be placed in boiling water for 10 minutes, then wash with cold water and drain.</li>
            <li>Separate the stems of the cilantro leaves, and discard the thicker stems. Chop all the rest very fine.</li>
            <li>Cut tomato into four and discard the seeds. Chop the rest into small cubes.</li>

            <li>It is better to let it rest for 1 hour before eating, so the flavors marry.</li>
            <li>Serve with whaterever you like the most. I encourage you to serve with <em>empanadas</em> or <em>sopaipillas</em>.</li>
